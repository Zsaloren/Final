<p>During quarantine, I spent time practicing my artistic crafts and improving my gardening skills. I began a part time job but was soon laid off due to Covid restrictions. 
So, during June of 2020, I made the decision to return to school in Orlando, FL and spent the rest of the year preparing to make the move here.</p>
